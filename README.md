# capillary_wave_simulation
This repository contains OpenFOAM case files for simulating capillary waves on liquid-air interface using interIsoFoam solver and dynamic mesh motion. There are separate folders for planar symmetric and axisymmetric cases. Parallel simulations can be run on clusters using the included batchfiles. The interface coordinates are extracted in the post-processing stage to be used for further processing.
It also contains MATLAB codes used in different stages of the post-processing.
